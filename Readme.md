# ABC Planner
## ABC Management Method.

ABC Planner is an application, that helps to organize and manage tasks, by facilitating the **"ABC" Time management method**.
This method is based on the task priority analysis, that would help to understand the current situation of user's time management. 
ABC method comes with the benefit of being straightforward to use and understand, which will allow the user to focus on more important items. 



The ABC analysis analysis differentiates between:
  * **Priority A tasks**: very important tasks, that usually can only be done by the user. They are not delegable and very important. 
  Their execution provides the highest value,
  
  * **Priority B tasks**: important tasks, that are partially delegatable and provide medium value,
  
  * **Priority C tasks**: are the least valuable towards performing a function, but they take up the most time 
  (routine work, paperwork, reading, telephoning, filing, correspondence, and other administrative tasks). 
  In most cases, the ratio of the time used stands in stark contrast to the value of the activity.
  
The ABC Analysis stands, that good work distribution would comply with the following rules:
  * only schedule one to two A-tasks per day (about three hours total)
  * make time for another two to three B-tasks (about one hour total)
  * reserve the rest for C-tasks (about Â¾ hours)
  
## The Planner

The app allows to create and keep track of the tasks for each task list. 
User can prioritize and track the progress of the task completion throughout the applicable task list.

## Important note
This app is still under development, the current state is not the final application state, however the ABC Planner provides the minimal value 
and can be used in its current state. There are many changes to come (especially from the UI/UX perspective).
